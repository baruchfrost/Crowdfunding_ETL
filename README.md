# Crowdfunding_ETL

Completed by S. Freeman and B. Frost

This project is a practice of building an ETL pipeline using Python, Pandas, and either Python dictionary methods or regular expressions to extract and transform the data. After transforming the data, the project creates four CSV files (contacts.csv, campaign.csv, category.csv, and subcategory.csv), which can be found in the Resources directory. Finally, the project culminates in the creation of the crowdfunding_db_schema.sql file, which can be used to create a postgresql database (crowdfunding_db) with four tables, in which the respective csv files can be imported to load the tables with data.
